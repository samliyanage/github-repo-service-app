- Number of stars
- Date of creation

## Features

- Fetches repository details from GitHub API.
- Caches the response in Redis for performance.
- Returns repository details through a REST API endpoint.

## Prerequisites

- Maven
- Redis server

### Maven Parent overrides

Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM.
While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent.
To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements.
If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.
